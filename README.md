## Why Logos?

Part of the requirement for the hackathon is the use of the Bolt.new badge:

> "The publicly deployed version of the Project interface must include a badge that highlights that it is built with Bolt.new."

## Badge Guidelines

As of June 12th, 2025 9:30AM Pacific:

> Here are some guidelines:
>
> **Mandatory Inclusion:** All submitted projects must display the Bolt.new badge on their publicly deployed version.  
> **Visibility:** The badge must be clearly visible to the public on the main home page.  
> **Placement:** Use your best judgement for your project's branding but we recommend placing the badge in the top right (as seen in the above example) or bottom right.  
> **Sizing:** The badge should be scalable and responsive to different screen sizes.  
> **Hyperlink:** All badges must hyperlink to [https://bolt.new/](https://bolt.new/).  
> **Badge Variations:**  
> - **White Circle:** Use on dark backgrounds for visibility.  
> - **Black Circle:** Use on light backgrounds for visibility.  
> - **Text Only:** Use on dark backgrounds if preferred over the circle for your project's branding.  
> **Files:** Shared in [public Drive Folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iNALInxyPJl7IHP5iywUKqsdumCrWIA0)
